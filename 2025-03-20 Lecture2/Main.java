   Students will learn to
   - understand static types of parameters and local variables
   - how to make a method call another method that is...
     - ...defined on the same class
     - ...defined on another object
   - call methods on String values as an example
   - understand the difference between primitive values and objects
   - use boolean operations in Java
   - use conditional statements ("if - else if - else" in Java)
   Help:
   - inventory: we will use the % operator, the == operator, if/else if/else, and String.format

   Plan:
   Problem 1
   - define a method for TicketFaster that:
   - consumes a name of a concert as a String and a number of tickets remaining
   - produces the string "Now Playing: %s %s" where:
     - the first %s is the name of the concert
     - the second %s is "only %d tickets left" and the %d is the number of tickets remaining
       if there are > 0 tickets remaining
     - the second %s is "!SOLD OUT!" if there are 0 tickets remaining
   - Steps:
     - stub out this method
     - write a test for it
     - try to implement it, but design/use/~*manifest*~ a helper method to determine the %s
     - stub out the helper method
     - write a test for it
     - implement it
     - test everything

   Problem 2
   - define a class ClassicInterview with a method fizzbuzz with the following behavior:
     - fizzbuzz consumes a number and produces
       - the string fizz when the number is divisible by 3
       - the string buzz when the number is divisible by 5
       - the string buzz when the number is divisible by 3 and 5
       - the number (as a string) otherwise (i.e. when the number is not divisible by 3 or 5)
